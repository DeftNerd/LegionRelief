<h1>About LaraBrain</h1>

<p>
The <a href="http://laravel.com/" target="_blank">Laravel</a> framework is an amazingly capable and practical solution for rapidly creating modern web applications. Packed with features and accompanied by <a href="http://laravel.com/docs/master" target="_blank">comprehensive documentation</a>, the framework has quickly risen to become the <a href="https://github.com/search?l=PHP&q=stars%3A%3E1&s=stars&type=Repositories" target="_blank">most popular PHP project on GitHub</a>.

Now if only I could remember all of the cool tips and tricks I've learned during my time building Laravel applications and writing about Laravel development!
</p>

Not only will I regularly be using LaraBrain as an information repository for all things Laravel, but so can you! <a href="/register">Registration is free</a>, and after three approved tip submissions you'll be automatically granted special approval to submit without further review!
